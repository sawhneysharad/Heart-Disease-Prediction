# Heart-Disease-Prediction

# Business Question:
"Can the symptoms like chest pain, signs of ageing, your gender i.e. male or female, Cholesterol level, heart rate etc. contribute to prediction of heart diseases"?
# Background:
Analysing the heart-disease-uci from kaggle datasets. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date.
# Conclusion of findings:
With the model, we are able to get the accuracy of 85%.
The majority of heart disease is found in the males in older age rather than females. 
The factors that are related to predict the heart disease are the ones that we have assessed.
Prediction can be improved using Neural Networks and Deep learning.
